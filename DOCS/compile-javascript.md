Building mpv with Javascript scripting support
==============================================

General
-------
mpv supports both Duktape and MuJS JS backends, and will auto-detect both.
Both have minimal dependencies (Duktape needs `libm` and MuJS not even that),
but neither of them uses pkg-config and both have to be fetched manually.

If both are present then mpv will build both into the same binary, but will
pick Duktape at runtime by default. To run a script with MuJS, use
`mpv --script-opts=js-backend=mujs`.

Duktape - http://duktape.org/
-----------------------------

In order to build mpv with Duktape, mpv needs `duktape.c` and `duktape.h`
from the release distribution of Duktape at directory `<mpv-src>/duktape` -
which you'll have to create manually and then copy these files into it.

The latest Duktape release distribution can be downloaded from
http://duktape.org/download.html as a `.tar.xz` archive or by cloning
https://github.com/svaarala/duktape-releases.git and then `git checkout`
the latest tag - which will have `src/duktape.*` files which mpv uses.

- Duktape currently has an MIT license.

MuJS - http://mujs.com/
-----------------------

Clone the MuJS sources - `git://git.ghostscript.com/mujs.git` (a mirror is
available at https://github.com/ccxvii/mujs ).

At the MuJS sources directory use `make && make install` (it copies
`libmujs.a` and `mujs.h` into `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/include`).

If you cross-compile, have `CC`, `AR` and `prefix` set accordingly.

- MuJS currently has an AGPLv3+ license.
